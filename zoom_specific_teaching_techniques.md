Zoom Specific Teaching Techniques
-------

Every teaching modality has specific teaching technique that it enables. Here are the ones I know about in Zoom:

1. __Breakout rooms__ - The "killer" feature of Zoom for teaching. However, you must post the instructions to chat before creating the rooms and instruct the students to copy them from chat. There is high switch cost so it at most once per hour.

1. __Private message guesses__ - I propose a question to the learners. They private message just me their guess. Since I have already estaiblished that I don't judge students, they know are safe to guess incorrect without their peers knowing. It works well for sensitive questions
