Teaching Principles
-----

> "We are currently preparing students for jobs that don’t yet exist, using technologies that haven’t been invented, in order to solve problems we don’t even know are problems yet."
> — Richard Riley

1. Student-centric - What is in the long-term best interest of my students?
1. Now Focus - What can I do right now with my current students as they are really are in the moment?
1. Know & Do - What should the students know? What should they be able to do?
1. Empirical - What evidence can I gather from the students to find out what they currently know and can do?
1. Constructively Challenge - How can I encourage students to find and fill gaps in their knowledge? How can I encourage students to solve novel (both new-to-them and new-to-the-world) problems?
1. Embrace the reality of teaching cutting-edge, technical curriculum:
    1. No perfect map of content or teaching techniques.
    1. I will make errors and mistakes. 
    2. An always changing landscape.
