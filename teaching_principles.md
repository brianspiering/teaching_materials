Teaching Principles
-----

"We are currently preparing students for jobs that don’t yet exist, using technologies that haven’t been invented, in order to solve problems we don’t even know are problems yet."
— Richard Riley

1. Student-centric - What is in the long-term best interest of students?
1. Now Focus - What can I do right now with my current students?
1. Know & Do - What should students know? What should they be able to do?
1. Empirical - What evidence can I gather from the students to find out what they know and can do?
1. Constructive Challenge - How can I encourage students to find and fill gaps in their knowledge? How can I encourage students to solve novel (both new-to-them and new-to-the-world) problems?
