Slack Guidelines: User Manual for Interacting with Brian on Slack
-------

Helpful suggestions:

- Please send complete messages. All information should be in a single message. I appreciate seeing and responding in a single pass.
- It is preferable to send a [multi-line message](https://www.wikihow.com/Enter-Multiple-Lines-on-Slack-on-PC-or-Mac) rather than a series of single line messages.
- Please [format your messages](https://slack.com/help/articles/202288908-Format-your-messages).
- Slack is not text messaging, thus:
    + Use complete sentences.
    + Do not over use abbreviations. Common business abbreviations are acceptable.
    + All lowercase is acceptable.
- Feel free to [edit your messages](https://slack.com/help/articles/202395258-Edit-or-delete-messages).
