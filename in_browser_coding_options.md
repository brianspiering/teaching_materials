In-Browswer Coding
-------

Current Favorites:

- [deepnote](deepnote.com) - For Jupyter Notebooks. Nice UI, easy to share, connects with code reposistories
- [Repl.it](Repl.it) - For all other coding. Easy to use, supports many languages.

Other options:

- Binder - open source. sometimes doesn't work and doesn't support new packages easily.
- colab - Google's version of Google Drive. Premessions can be a problem. UI is clunky.
