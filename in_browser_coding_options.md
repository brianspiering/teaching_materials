In-Browswer Coding
-------

Current Favorites:

- [Deepnote](deepnote.com) - For Jupyter Notebooks. Nice UI, easy to share, connects with code reposistories.
- [Repl.it](Repl.it) - For all other coding. Easy to use, supports many languages.

Other options:

- [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb) - Google's Jupyter Notebooks in the cloud. Similar to Google Drive. Permissions can be a problem. UI is clunky.
- [Anaconda Cloud Notebooks](https://anaconda.cloud/anaconda-tools) - A great offering from a great organization.
- [Trinket](https://trinket.io/) - Similar to repl.it.
- [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) - Sometimes doesn't work and doesn't support new packages easily. Welcome to the [bazaar of open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar).
