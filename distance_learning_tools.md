I was hesitant to even post my suggested list of distance learning tools.

*SPECFICIC TOOLS ARE NOT IMPORTANT*

In my experience, instructor knowledge and passion are the most important elements for student learning. Then, the specific tactics matter (e.g., using active learning techniques whenever possible). Tools are the medium to support the learning process. If the instructor or students are distracted by the tools, something is wrong. 

Pick tools that work for you. Here are the tools that work for me right now:

- Zoom - Video calls that allow for frictionless screen sharing and breakout rooms for small group activities.

- A tablet & stylus - Anything works. A digital whiteboard during a Zoom call (never run out of space or marker!).

- repl.it - Everyone can code in the same editor at the same time in almost any language. I often create skeleton code to help student avoid blinking cursor paralysis.

- show.veda.ai - A web app to live stream from the camera on my phone to the web. I prefer physical demos whenever possible.
