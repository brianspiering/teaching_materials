Steps to use an iPad as a whiteboard on Zoom 
-----

1. Plug in iPad with a physical cable to Mac.
2. Start whiteboard app on iPad. The built-in Notes app works well.
3. Start Quicktime Player on Mac.
    1. Select "New Movie Recording"
    1. Select down arrow just to the right of the red record button.
    1. Switch camera to iPad.
    1. Wait a couple momentsâ€¦
4. Your iPad screen should appear as a separate window on Mac. It is a real-time feed of your iPad. You can move and resize as you see fit.  
5. Slides (or any other app) can be shown at the same time during screen sharing in Zoom.
5. Select any other app than Quicktime Player for the recoding overly menu to disappear. 

Note: This probably works with any tablet and a Mac. However, I have not tested it with other setups.
